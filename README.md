# My-projects
In this i will upload all my projects that i am going to do or had done since my beginning of the journey. Hope, you will find my projects interesting and like them.
### 1. Apple revenue
This is data that i have downloaded from kaggle. There has information about the stock price of apple stocks from 1980 to 2022 with volume of stocks every since 1980. I have sorted the data using pandas which is module in python that is used in importing and sorting the data. Afterwards, matplotlib and seaborn module is also used for the visualisation of data with little use of numpy. All the actions are taken in jupyter notebook from importing to sorting of data and from cleaning to visualising of data.
