# My-projects
In this I will upload all my projects that I am going to do or had done since my beginning of the journey. Hope, you will find my projects interesting and like them.

### 1. Apple revenue
This is data that I downloaded from kaggle. There has information about the stock price of apple stocks from 1980 to 2022 with volume of stocks every since 1980. I have sorted the data using pandas which is module in python that is used in importing and sorting the data. Afterwards, matplotlib and seaborn module is also used for the visualisation of data with little use of numpy. All the actions are taken in jupyter notebook from importing to sorting of data and from cleaning to visualising of data.

### 2. San Francisco Buildings Permits
This dataset is downloaded from kaggle. There are about 43 columns and 1,98,900 rows which are present in the dataset. This data is updated by San Francisco Open Data portal every Saturday. In this data due large number of columns, I have to select fewer column make field over which I would analyse data and I have done that in this project eventhough missing and wrong values. Afterwards, I have try to visualise the cleaned and sorted data.

### 3. Space missions
The dataset consist of all space missions from 1957 to August 2022, including details on the location, date, and result of the launch, the company responsible, and the name, price, and status of the rocket used for the mission. It is downloaded from Maven Analytics. Exploration of the universe is the dream of every scientist and to accomplish that dream space missions have taken place since a long time with some successful attempts and today I am here to analyse about space missions that had taken place in past to extract some valuable information.
